README: pcd8544
---------------

This project is not provided in the book, but is made available here
in the event that the experimenter might find it useful. The PCD8544
LCD controller chip is used in small LCD displays like the notable
Nokia 5110 display, applied to Arduino/AVR class MCUs.

Many folks wire these up using SPI, though there is no real reason
that you must. The PCD8544 is a bit of a nuisance on SPI because of
the additional required Data/Command status line. The PCD8544
operates at clock rates up to 4 MHz, and uses a 3 volt interface.
These factors make it real easy to use on the Raspberry Pi, using
simple GPIO connections (saving SPI for other more critical tasks).

The software provided here uses "bit-banging" to drive the LCD
display. This works well because the timing is non-critical and
the controller will wait for the RPi, should it get temporarily
busy with something else.

The software provided here provides a "text" interface to the LCD,
rather than a graphics one. The software can be adapted to graphics,
but this has not been done in this project. The library provides
the following C routines for application use:

    void lcd_init(int vop);                     /* Initialize PCD8544 */
    void lcd_home(void);                        /* Home cursor */
    void lcd_sety(int y);                       /* Move to line 0-5 */
    void lcd_setx(int x);                       /* Move to col 0-13 */
    void lcd_move(int y,int x);                 /* Move to y,x */
    void lcd_clear(void);                       /* Clear screen & home cursor */
    void lcd_clrtobot(void);                    /* Clear from position to end screen */
    void lcd_clrtoeol(void);                    /* Clear from position to end of line */
    void lcd_printf(const char *format,...);    /* Format and display message */

    int lcd_getx();                             /* Return current X position */
    int lcd_gety();                             /* Return current Y position */
    char lcd_char();                            /* Return current char at position */

more details about the other aspects of this source code (like the GPIO
routines).
