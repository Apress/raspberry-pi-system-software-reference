The current snapshot of the git repository is available by executing
the command:

$ git clone git@github.com:ve3wwg/raspberry_pi.git

The source code will be deposited into your subdirectory ./raspberry_pi

On the Raspberry Pi, simply cd to this directory and type:

  $ make

Or you may cd into any project subdirectory and type make:

  $ cd ./bipolar
  $ make

If you make changes to the source code and you want to rebuild 
completely from scratch, you can use:

  $ make clobber all
